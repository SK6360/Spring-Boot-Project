# Spring-Boot-Project
The project is a web based application built using Rest Spring Boot that serves as an API for a Banking System Management. The main features of the banking system included account creation and management, depositing and withdrawing, transferring funds between accounts, viewing account balances and transaction history, and generating reports.. The endpoints are built using Rest Spring Boot and are exposed through HTTP requests. Postman is used as a tool to test the various endpoints and ensure that the application is working as expected. The application is designed to be scalable and can handle a large number of users and requests. The codebase is structured in a modular way, with separate modules for each endpoint and database operations. The application uses MySQL as the database and is configured using Spring Data JPA. The endpoints are secured using Spring Security and require users to authenticate before making any requests.
